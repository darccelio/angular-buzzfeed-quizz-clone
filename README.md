# ProjetoBuzzfeed

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

This project was refactored based on the Digital Innovation One project fork. To enhance its features, I developed a reactive form selector, which allows users to choose question themes and subsequently displays questions for them to answer. Ultimately, the application presents the result that is most likely applicable to the user. Finally, users have the option to restart the application and respond to other questions.

## Development server
First, run `json-server --watch db/data.json` to start a fake API server using json-server. Open another terminal and run `npm start` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
